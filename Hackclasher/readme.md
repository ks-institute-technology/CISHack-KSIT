Problem Statement : FinTech

Problem Description : 
TO Deploy Technology and innovation to identify and mitigate patterns of money flows which are indicative of money laundering,
 terrorist financing, or other financial crime

Problem Solution :
We shall design a Machine learning model to detect smurfing in banks and financial institutions and prepare SAR's
 (Suspicious Activity Report) to analyze the activities effectively and report to concerned departments/authority.
We shall train our Machine Learning model with all previous money laundering cases which have happened over the globe and analyze the flow patterns and methodologies used before and based on that data transactions we feed that data and train our model to detect any such suspicions and we keep track of some risky profile of bank accounts based on KYC

Tech Stack
Python3,Django,HTML5,CSS3,JS6,Bootstrap

Unique Idea:
To altert all bank if any suspicions identified and monitor those.
It keeps track of each transaction of risk profiles.
Builds network tree of mony flows to check the pattern.
To keep track of changes on the GDP rates.[Hackclasher.pptx](https://github.com/narasimha-maiya/CISHack-KSIT/files/6316630/Hackclasher.pptx)
