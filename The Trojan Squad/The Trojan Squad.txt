IDEA BRIEF:

Our idea is to develop a patient-centered information exchange system which provides a systematic storage for patient medical information, which is easily accessible to patients and doctors. This application has three users namely, Patients,Doctors/Experts and Hospital Administration. Patients can view their medical records while doctors can view and update/modify the patient's medical records.Doctors who also work as experts can chat with the patients and provide necessary services/suggestions considering the symptoms mentioned by the patients. 

TECH STACK:

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap v4.5 , JavaScript, PHP, Python, MySQL, XAMPP, Visual studio code, Atom

POSITIVE AND UNIQUE SOLUTIONS:

●	This web application gives an option to the patients to upload/update their basic test results such as BP, Sugar level, Pulse rate, Oxygen Saturation level, etc.
●	Patients can also chat with experts (experts are none other than specialised doctors working in various hospitals) for consultations in the provided chatroom.
●	The doctors can view details of the patients along with their medical records based on which  the doctor can suggest a diet chart.
●	The hospital administration can view , access and update patient records by adding/removing reports on latest developments in patient’s health as suggested by the doctor.
●	The progress in health (w.r.t Basic test results such as BP, sugar rate, pulse rate, O2 saturation rate, etc) of the patients will be represented in the form of graphs.

WAYS TO HOST OUR PROJECT ON LOCALHOST:
●	XAMPP
●	LIVE SERVER AND PHP SERVER (Extensions) ON VISUAL STUDIO CODE.
