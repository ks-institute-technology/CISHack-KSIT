Project Topic : Personal Medical Assistance
PROBLEM : In this current situation, it is difficult for the people to approach doctors in hospitals for their assistance, and even the schedules of the doctors arenâ€™t known so this leads to certain inconveniences.

IDEA  :
To avoid going to hospitals and waiting for consulting doctor we can get the required medical assistance from the doctor through the website in personal ways.
We will have an website designed in which the patient can get the medical assistance directly from the specialized doctors. The patient can consult any of their preferred doctor through this website via chat or call.

Benifits:
The patient receives the utmost benefit by receiving the treatment for their problem .
The patient will have an option to choose any doctor based  on their comfort.
If the patient is not convinced he/she can get the aid from other doctor.
Its time saving and more effective.
