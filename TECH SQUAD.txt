ALGORITHM VISUALIZATION-This project help students to understand the algorithms like bubble sort,
linear search,binary search etc very easily and clearly .In addition to the mathematical and empirical 
analyses of algorithms,there is yet a third way to study algorithms.It is called algorithm visualizer 
and can be defined as the use of images to convey some useful information about algorithm.That 
information can be a visual illustration of an algorithm's operation ,of it's performance on different 
kinds of inputs.To accomplish this goal,an algorithm visualizer uses 3-D bars to represent some 
intersecting events in algorithm's operation
