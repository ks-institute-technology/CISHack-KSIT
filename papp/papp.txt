The classification of benign and malignant lung nodules has great significance for the early detection of lung cancer, 
since early diagnosis of nodules can greatly increase patient survival.

we plan to make different models including logistic regression, svm and anns 
to make predictions about the cancer types: benign (non cancerous) and malignant (cancerous)

The data set has 569 instances or data of 569 tumors 
and includes data on 30 attributes or features like the radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc. of a tumor.
 We will be using these features to train our model and predict the target.
 this model can be further used for early detection of tumours and help several many lives
