Creating and manipulating tables that contain data in conventional tabular format. 
Multiple tables are connected by data relationship and create virtual tables, stored in your computer’s RAM or temporary disk files. 
Data entry and editing requires design and implementation of data viewing, entry and editing forms as an alternative to tabular presentation.
A form lets you, rather than the application, control how the data is presented. Most users find forms much easier to use for data entry than tabular format, especially when many fields are involved.
Data presentation requires the creation of reports that you can view, print, or publish on the Internet or an Intranet. Charts and graphs summarize the data for those officials who take the “broad brush” approach.
