                    <h2>About Course</h2><br>
                    <p>With a PCMB combination of subjects, your capacity to understand and memorize the toughest concepts eventually becomes stronger as you are exposed to a lot of technical concepts, scientific theories and practical questions. At the same time, the difficulty level of a PCMB combination is quite high, since you’ll be managing both Mathematics and Biology, as opposed to a relatively lighter subject (like Computer Science, Physical Education, etc.). With school studies, entrance exam preparation and coaching classes, you would be dealing with a very hectic schedule, with very less time left for recreational activities.

                        Thus, it is important for you to judge if you can manage all of these or not. Preparation for these subjects can be handled conveniently, provided it is done with proper planning and focus.
                        <br><br><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><br>
                    <h4>Pros</h4><br>
                    There are a lot of career fields today that are interdisciplinary in nature, lying at the junction between Math, Biology and other sciences. These are fields you can explore only if you have a knowledge of both Mathematics and Biology, such as Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Bio-Statistics, Epidemiology, Bio-Informatics, Bio-Mathematics, Population Ecology, Genetic Engineering, Bio-Mechanics, Agricultural Engineering, and so on. If these fields interest you and you wish to explore a career in any of them, then opting for Mathematics and Biology together would make sense.

Before you decide to pursue any of these careers, make sure that you do your thorough research about them, what the fields are, their scope and professional opportunities, etc. Do not take the plunge just because these fields sound interesting, but make an informed choice.
                    <br><br><h4>Cons</h4><br>
                    Undoubtedly, a PCMB subject combination makes you eligible for virtually all career options out there. From Medicine to Research to Business to Social Sciences, you can explore a plethora of career options after your class 12th. While you’ll be spoilt for choice, having too many choices isn’t always a good thing, it can make you more confused about your career choices. Right now, since you are just entering class 11th, you still have time to explore and shortlist career options for yourself.

                    During your class 12th, you would be engaged with your board exams and entrance exams preparation. Amidst managing all these other things, making your career choice from an umpteen number of options is only going to make your job harder and possibly less accurate. Thus, it is advisable to shortlist your career options right away and choose the best stream and subjects aligned to them.<br>
                    <br><h4>Career Options</h4><br>
                    Students who have had PCMB Subjects (AB group) will have access to all the professional courses (both mathematics and biology related). Note: Many courses can be pursued by both Mathematics and Biology group students (example- Law, Management courses, B Pharmacy etc).<br>

 

Science stream students are also eligible to pursue professional courses from other streams. For example, science stream students may go for relevant B.Com. course, B.A. course as well as Chartered Accountancy course!<br>
